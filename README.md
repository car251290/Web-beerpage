# Working in Beer page.
This project where I am working on I am using an API for searching the beer information because I will use a serach bar for getting your favorite beer, Also I am coding this project on React using JavaScript ES6 and basic knowledge of HTML and CSS for coding the styles and the background.

## Continue learning React 
Add an search bar where the usar can use for the searching of the beer and using the concept if state, to fetch the API that will help to search the information of the beer

## Function Components and Class Components
With React, you can make components using either classes or functions. Originally, class components were the only components that could have state. But since the introduction of React's Hooks API, you can add state and more to function component

# Card

Cards are a great way to display information, usually containing content and actions about a single subject. Cards can contain images, buttons, text and more.
I am using this Cards for get the strings display in a Card where can get the image and the information of the beer
